This proposal outlines the development of a decentralized social media platform designed to empower researchers, academics, and the general public to share and discuss scientific ideas effectively. Recognizing the limitations of existing platforms, our solution will provide robust support for mathematical typesetting, enabling clear communication of complex concepts. By allowing individuals and institutions to self-host their instances, we will promote data ownership and privacy while fostering collaboration across the scientific community. Utilizing an Agile development model, we will ensure flexibility and responsiveness to user needs throughout the project lifecycle. Ultimately, this platform aims to bridge the gap between specialized communities and the public, enhancing the understanding and appreciation of scientific research.
